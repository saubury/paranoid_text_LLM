## Setup virtual python environment
Create a [virtual python](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) environment to keep dependencies separate. The _venv_ module is the preferred way to create and manage virtual environments.

 ```console
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll need to activate it. 

```console
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
